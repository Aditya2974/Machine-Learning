# Machine-Learning

Consists of Important machine learning models and focuses on Unsupervised Learning.

UNsupervised Learning : 

K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering are types of Clustering

 => scipy and sklearn was used mainly to train the models.
 => Main part of Hierarchical Clustering includes Dendrograms whichs plot Euclidean Distance and is very helpful in deciding clusters.
 => Main part in K-means is Minimizing the distance between the centroids of each cluster . 
 => ELBOW METHOD : WCSS ==> Within Cluster Sum Square!
